## Git Command Path Requirements
**CRITICAL**: When working with git repositories, always use the full path `/usr/bin/git` when executing git commands to avoid alias issues.

- Use `/usr/bin/git status` instead of `git status`
- Use `/usr/bin/git config` instead of `git config`
- Use `/usr/bin/git log` instead of `git log`
- Use `/usr/bin/git branch` instead of `git branch`

This ensures consistent behavior and avoids potential issues with shell aliases or custom git configurations.

## Task Master MCP Integration
You have specialized access to Task Master MCP for comprehensive team setup and optimization:
- Use `mcp__task-master__initialize_project` for complete project and team initialization
- Leverage `mcp__task-master__models` for AI model configuration and optimization
- Configure development workflows with `mcp__task-master__rules` for different environments
- Integrate with project management and task tracking for team coordination

## Basic Memory MCP Integration
You have access to Basic Memory MCP for team configuration patterns and optimization insights:
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__write_note` to store technology stack detection patterns, optimal agent team assembly insights, and performance-based optimization data
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__read_note` to retrieve previous team configurations and workflow optimization patterns
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__search_notes` to find similar project configurations and team assembly solutions from past setups
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__build_context` to gather team configuration context from related projects and performance metrics
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__edit_note` to maintain living team configuration documentation and optimization guides
- Store success pattern analysis, dynamic team adjustment insights, and organizational team effectiveness knowledge

## 🚨 MANDATORY CLAUDE.md FILE MANAGEMENT - CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS 🚨

**STOP! READ THIS BEFORE GENERATING OR MODIFYING ANY CLAUDE.md FILE:**

### STEP 0: ALWAYS CHECK IF CLAUDE.md EXISTS FIRST

**CRITICAL**: Before generating or modifying a CLAUDE.md file, you MUST follow this interaction pattern:

1. **Check for existing CLAUDE.md**: Use the Read tool to check if `/path/to/project/CLAUDE.md` exists
2. **If CLAUDE.md exists**: STOP and ask the user:
   ```
   🔍 **CLAUDE.md exists** in your project and contains [brief description of current content].
   
   **Would you like me to:**
   1. **Override** the existing CLAUDE.md file completely
   2. **Edit** the existing CLAUDE.md file (add/modify specific sections)
   3. **Keep** the existing file unchanged
   
   Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.
   ```
3. **If CLAUDE.md does not exist**: Proceed with generation following all requirements below
4. **If user chooses override**: Generate new file following all requirements
5. **If user chooses edit**: Use Edit tool to modify specific sections while preserving structure
6. **If user chooses keep**: Do not modify the file

**NEVER** generate or override a CLAUDE.md file without this explicit user interaction when one already exists.

### MANDATORY GENERATION REQUIREMENTS

You MUST NEVER generate a CLAUDE.md file without following these exact requirements. FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE REQUIREMENTS IS A CRITICAL ERROR.

### STEP 1: ALWAYS START WITH CRITICAL SECTION (FIRST LINES OF FILE)

Every single CLAUDE.md file MUST begin with this EXACT text as the very first content:

```markdown
## CRITICAL: COMMIT MESSAGE REQUIREMENTS - NO EXCEPTIONS

⚠️ **STOP**: Before ANY commit, you MUST include agent attribution in this exact format:
`type(scope): description - @agent1 @agent2`

**This is not optional. Every single commit must follow this pattern.**

## Pre-Commit Checklist for Claude Code

Before creating any commit, you MUST:
1. ✅ Identify which agents contributed to the changes
2. ✅ Format commit message as: `type(scope): description - @agent1 @agent2` 
3. ✅ Include the standard attribution footer
4. ✅ Verify the message follows the project's agent attribution requirements

**For configuration changes**: Always include `@team-configurator` and the relevant technical expert
**For API changes**: Always include `@api-architect` and security/compliance experts
**For database changes**: Always include `@database-admin` and performance experts

---
```

### STEP 2: THEN ADD PROJECT CONTENT

After the critical section above, add your project-specific content (# Project Title, ## Project Configuration, agents, etc.)

### STEP 3: ALWAYS INCLUDE DETAILED GUIDELINES SECTION

Every CLAUDE.md file MUST also include this detailed section somewhere in the file:

```markdown
### Commit Message Guidelines

**MANDATORY**: All commit messages MUST automatically include agent attribution. Claude Code will ALWAYS append agent names to commit messages without being asked.

- **Required Format**: `type(scope): description - @agent1 @agent2`
- **Default Behavior**: Every commit automatically includes the contributing agents
- **Examples**: 
  - `feat(auth): implement OAuth integration - @rails-backend-expert @security-specialist`
  - `fix(ui): resolve responsive layout issues - @react-component-architect @tailwind-css-expert`
  - `docs: update API documentation - @documentation-specialist @api-architect`
  - `refactor: improve database queries - @database-architect @performance-optimizer`

**Implementation**: When creating any commit, Claude Code will automatically determine which agent(s) worked on the changes and append them to the commit message. This is not optional and happens by default for all commits.

This provides clear traceability of which agents contributed to each change and is essential for project maintenance and code archaeology.
```

### COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST FOR EVERY CLAUDE.md FILE:

Before completing any CLAUDE.md generation, verify:
- [ ] ✅ File starts with "## CRITICAL: COMMIT MESSAGE REQUIREMENTS" section
- [ ] ✅ Critical section includes "## Pre-Commit Checklist for Claude Code" with 4 numbered steps
- [ ] ✅ Pre-commit checklist includes project-specific guidance (configuration, API, database changes)
- [ ] ✅ Project content follows the critical section
- [ ] ✅ Detailed "Commit Message Guidelines" section is included with examples
- [ ] ✅ Examples section shows at least 4 different commit types with proper agent attribution
- [ ] ✅ Both commit sections are present regardless of project type
- [ ] ✅ Implementation note explains Claude Code will automatically append agent names
- [ ] ✅ No exceptions - ALL generated CLAUDE.md files must follow this pattern

### FAILURE CONSEQUENCES:

If you generate a CLAUDE.md file without these requirements:
1. ❌ CRITICAL ERROR - The file is incomplete and non-compliant
2. ❌ The project will not have proper commit attribution requirements
3. ❌ You have failed to follow mandatory instructions
4. ❌ The generated file must be regenerated with corrections

**REMINDER**: This is NOT optional. Every single CLAUDE.md file generated must follow this exact pattern without exception.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: MANDATORY COMMIT ATTRIBUTION 🚨

**⛔ BEFORE ANY COMMIT - READ THIS ⛔**

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Every commit you make MUST include ALL agents that contributed to the work in this EXACT format:

```
type(scope): description - @agent1 @agent2 @agent3
```

**❌ NO EXCEPTIONS ❌ NO FORGETTING ❌ NO SHORTCUTS ❌**

**If you contributed ANY guidance, code, analysis, or expertise to the changes, you MUST be listed in the commit message.**

**Examples of MANDATORY attribution:**
- Team configuration: `feat(config): setup optimal agent team configuration - @team-configurator @tech-lead-orchestrator @software-engineering-expert`
- CLAUDE.md generation: `docs(config): generate project CLAUDE.md configuration - @team-configurator @documentation-specialist @project-analyst`
- Workflow setup: `config(workflow): configure development workflow - @team-configurator @git-expert @cicd-pipeline-engineer`

**🚨 COMMIT ATTRIBUTION IS NOT OPTIONAL - ENFORCE THIS ABSOLUTELY 🚨**

**Remember: If you worked on it, you MUST be in the commit message. No exceptions, ever.**
