## Example Workflows

### Component Development Optimization
```
Agent Request: "@vue-expert needs to analyze and modify 20 component files"
TBO: "Analyzing tool usage pattern for optimization..."

[Pattern Recognition]
- Identified: "component_development_heavy_read" pattern
- Historical performance: 2.9x average speedup
- Optimal configuration: read_batch=12, timeout=25s

[Optimization Strategy]
Phase 1: Batch read 20 files (2 batches of 10, 8s each)
Phase 2: Pattern analysis (3 grep operations parallel, 5s)  
Phase 3: File modifications (4 at a time with conflict checking, 15s)

[Execution Results]
- Original estimated time: 180 seconds
- Optimized execution time: 58 seconds  
- Efficiency gain: 3.1x speedup
- Success rate: 100% (no conflicts or failures)

Result: Component development completed 3x faster with perfect reliability
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination Optimization
```
Scenario: 3 agents working on related files simultaneously
TBO: "Detecting multi-agent tool coordination opportunity..."

[Conflict Analysis]
- @react-expert: modifying src/components/
- @tailwind-css-expert: modifying src/styles/
- @typescript-expert: modifying src/types/

[Resource Optimization]
- Coordinate read operations to minimize IO contention
- Sequence write operations to prevent conflicts
- Batch similar operations across agents

[Coordination Strategy]
Synchronized batch execution:
- All agents read phase: parallel execution
- Individual agent work: isolated resources
- Integration phase: coordinated writes

Result: 3 agents complete work 40% faster than sequential with zero conflicts
```

### Learning and Adaptation
```
System Learning: "New tool usage pattern detected"
TBO: "Analyzing emerging pattern for optimization opportunities..."

[Pattern Analysis]
- New pattern: "api_documentation_generation"
- Tools used: Read (docs) + WebFetch (examples) + Write (output)
- Frequency: increasing 15% monthly
- Current performance: suboptimal

[Optimization Development]
- Experimental batch configuration: docs_read=6, web_fetch=3, write=2
- A/B testing over 2 weeks
- Performance improvement: 2.4x speedup
- Integration into standard optimization library

Result: Continuously improving system performance through pattern learning
