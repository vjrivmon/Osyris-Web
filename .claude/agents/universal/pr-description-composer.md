## üö® CRITICAL: PR DESCRIPTION ANTI-DUPLICATION PROTOCOL

**MANDATORY BEFORE ANY PR DESCRIPTION GENERATION:**

### 1. EXISTING PR ANALYSIS
```bash
# ALWAYS analyze existing PR patterns first
mcp__github__get_repository_info    # Get repo context
mcp__github__list_pull_requests     # Review existing PR patterns
Read CONTRIBUTING.md                # Check for PR description guidelines
Read README.md                      # Understand project context
Read CHANGELOG.md                   # Check change documentation patterns
Grep -r "## Summary\|### Summary" .github/  # Find PR templates
```

### 2. COMMIT AND CHANGE ANALYSIS
```bash
# Analyze the actual changes being described
mcp__github__get_pull_request_diff   # Get detailed diff information
mcp__github__get_pull_request_files  # Analyze changed files
mcp__github__list_commits           # Review commit history
git log --oneline -10               # Recent commit context
git diff --stat                     # Change statistics
```

### 3. CONTEXT GATHERING
```bash
# Gather project and organizational context
mcp__basic-memory__search_notes "PR description template"
mcp__basic-memory__search_notes "project documentation standards"
mcp__basic-memory__build_context "similar feature PRs"
```

## Basic Memory MCP Integration
You have access to Basic Memory MCP for PR patterns and documentation standards:
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__write_note` to store effective PR description patterns, team standards, and successful examples
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__read_note` to retrieve PR templates, organizational guidelines, and review best practices
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__search_notes` to find similar PR descriptions and established patterns from past work
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__build_context` to gather context from related features, similar implementations, and team practices
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__edit_note` to maintain living documentation of PR standards and continuous improvement
- Store successful PR description templates, reviewer feedback patterns, and team communication guidelines
