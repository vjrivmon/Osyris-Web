## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Memory Storage Policy

**NEVER create files with Write tool.** All persistent storage MUST use Basic Memory MCP:

- Use `mcp__basic-memory__write_note` to store ML engineering patterns
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__read_note` to retrieve previous ML implementations
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__search_notes` to find similar ML patterns
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__build_context` to gather ML context
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__edit_note` to maintain living ML documentation

**‚ùå FORBIDDEN**: `Write(file_path: "~/basic-memory/")` or any file creation for memory/notes
**‚úÖ CORRECT**: `mcp__basic-memory__write_note(title: "...", content: "...", folder: "...")`

## üîç Pre-Commit Quality Checks

**MANDATORY**: Before any commit involving Python/ML code, run these quality checks:

### Type Checking with Pyright
```bash
# Install Pyright (if not already installed)
npm install -g pyright

# Run type checking ONLY on changed Python files
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=AM | grep '\.py$' | xargs pyright

# Or for specific ML files you modified
pyright src/models/classifier.py src/data/preprocessing.py notebooks/experiment.py
```

**Requirements**:
- Zero Pyright errors allowed on changed files
- All ML functions, classes, data pipelines must have proper type hints
- Use typing for NumPy arrays, pandas DataFrames, model objects
- **MANDATORY: Use strong typing throughout**:
  - All function parameters and return types explicitly typed
  - String literals use `Literal["value"]` for constants or `str` for variables
  - Collections use generic types: `list[str]`, `dict[str, int]`, etc.
  - Optional types use `Optional[T]` or `T | None`
  - Union types explicit: `Union[str, int]` or `str | int`
  - NumPy arrays: `np.ndarray[Any, np.dtype[np.float64]]` or `npt.NDArray[np.float64]`
  - Pandas DataFrames: `pd.DataFrame` with column typing when possible
- Add `# type: ignore` comments only when absolutely necessary with explanation

### Additional Quality Tools for ML Projects
```bash
# Get list of changed Python files
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=AM | grep '\.py$')

# Code formatting (only changed files)
echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | xargs black
echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | xargs isort

# Linting (only changed files)
echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | xargs ruff check
echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | xargs ruff check --fix

# Security scanning (only changed files)
echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | xargs bandit -ll

# ML-specific validation (run tests that might be affected)
# Test only relevant model/pipeline tests or run all if core components changed
pytest tests/ -v
python -m pytest tests/test_models.py -v

# Complete ML quality check workflow for changed files
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=AM | grep '\.py$') && \
echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | xargs pyright && \
echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | xargs black && \
echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | xargs isort && \
echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | xargs ruff check && \
echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | xargs bandit -ll && \
pytest tests/ -v
```

**Quality Standards for ML Projects**:
- Pyright type checking: **ZERO ERRORS**  
- All data processing functions have proper type hints
- Model training/inference code is properly typed
- Code formatting: black + isort compliance
- Linting: ruff clean (no warnings)
- Security: bandit clean (no high/medium severity issues)
- Tests: All model and data pipeline tests pass
