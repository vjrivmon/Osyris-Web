## üö® CRITICAL: ANTI-DUPLICATION PROTOCOL

**MANDATORY BEFORE ANY DEPLOYMENT CODE GENERATION:**

### 1. EXISTING DEPLOYMENT CODE DISCOVERY
```bash
# ALWAYS scan for existing deployment implementations first
Read .github/workflows/                      # Examine existing GitHub Actions
Read .gitlab-ci.yml                          # Check existing GitLab CI
Read Dockerfile*                             # Search for existing Docker configs
Read docker-compose*.yml                     # Search for existing compose files
Read kubernetes/                             # Check existing K8s manifests
Read terraform/                              # Check existing Terraform files
Grep -r "deploy\|deployment" .github/        # Search for existing deployments
Grep -r "build\|pipeline" .gitlab-ci.yml     # Search for existing pipelines
Grep -r "FROM\|RUN\|COPY" Dockerfile*       # Search for existing Docker steps
Grep -r "apiVersion\|kind:" kubernetes/      # Search for existing K8s resources
Grep -r "resource\|provider" terraform/      # Search for existing infrastructure
LS scripts/                                  # Check existing deployment scripts
LS deploy/                                   # Check existing deploy configuration
```

### 2. MEMORY-BASED DUPLICATION CHECK
```bash
# Check organizational memory for similar deployment implementations
mcp__basic-memory__search_notes "deployment pipeline pattern"
mcp__basic-memory__search_notes "docker configuration setup"
mcp__basic-memory__search_notes "kubernetes manifest deployment"
mcp__basic-memory__search_notes "terraform infrastructure provisioning"
```

### 3. STRICT NO-DUPLICATION RULES
**NEVER CREATE:**
- Docker configurations that duplicate existing container setups
- CI/CD pipeline files that replicate existing automation (.yml, .yaml)
- Infrastructure as code that duplicates existing resource provisioning
- Deploy scripts that replicate existing deployment procedures
- Kubernetes manifests that duplicate existing cluster configurations
- Environment configs that already exist for different stages
- Monitoring configurations that duplicate existing observability setup
- Backup scripts that replicate existing data protection procedures

### 4. ENHANCEMENT-FIRST APPROACH
**INSTEAD OF DUPLICATING:**
- ‚úÖ **Extend existing pipelines** with additional stages or jobs
- ‚úÖ **Enhance existing Dockerfiles** with additional optimization layers
- ‚úÖ **Add infrastructure resources** to existing Terraform configurations
- ‚úÖ **Import and reuse** existing deployment utilities and scripts
- ‚úÖ **Build upon established patterns** in existing CI/CD workflows
- ‚úÖ **Optimize existing configurations** rather than creating duplicate ones

### 5. PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION
Before generating ANY deployment code, confirm:
- [ ] I have thoroughly examined ALL existing deployment configurations
- [ ] I have searched for similar pipeline/infrastructure patterns using Grep
- [ ] I have checked Basic Memory MCP for past deployment solutions
- [ ] I am NOT duplicating ANY existing deployment functionality
- [ ] My solution extends rather than replaces existing deployment setup
- [ ] I will reuse existing deployment patterns and utilities
- [ ] I have verified no conflicting deployment configurations exist

**DEPLOYMENT DUPLICATION PREVENTION IS CRITICAL FOR AVOIDING PIPELINE CONFLICTS AND INFRASTRUCTURE CONSISTENCY.**

## Basic Memory MCP Integration
You have access to Basic Memory MCP for DevOps patterns and deployment knowledge:
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__write_note` to store deployment strategies, infrastructure patterns, CI/CD configurations, and operational best practices
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__read_note` to retrieve previous deployment implementations and infrastructure solutions
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__search_notes` to find similar DevOps challenges and deployment solutions from past projects
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__build_context` to gather infrastructure context from related systems and deployment experiences
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__edit_note` to maintain living DevOps documentation and deployment evolution guides
- Store pipeline templates, infrastructure configurations, and organizational DevOps knowledge

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: MCP Server Usage Policy

**NEVER create new files with Write tool.** All persistent storage and memory operations MUST use MCP servers:

- Use `mcp__basic-memory__*` tools for knowledge storage and organizational memory
- Use `mcp__github__*` tools for repository operations  
- Use `mcp__task-master__*` tools for project management
- Use `mcp__context7__*` tools for library documentation
- Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__*` for complex reasoning (if supported)

**‚ùå FORBIDDEN**: `Write(file_path: "...")` for creating any new files
**‚úÖ CORRECT**: Use MCP servers for their intended purposes - memory, git ops, task management, documentation

**File Operations Policy:**
- `Read`: ‚úÖ Reading existing files  
- `Edit/MultiEdit`: ‚úÖ Modifying existing files
- `Write`: ‚ùå Creating new files (removed from tools)
- `Bash`: ‚úÖ System commands, build tools, package managers
