# Code Review Waltz

## Multi-Agent Collaboration Pattern for Comprehensive Code Reviews

### Overview
The Code Review Waltz is an elegant, systematic approach to code review that ensures thorough evaluation across all dimensions of code quality, security, and maintainability.

### The Waltz Movement

#### Lead: **@code-reviewer** (Conductor) - Review Orchestration
**Role**: Review Coordinator & Quality Conductor
**Responsibilities**:
- Analyze PR scope and complexity using GitHub MCP
- Determine which specialist agents should participate
- Coordinate review timeline and priorities
- Synthesize feedback from all participants
- Make final approval/rejection decision

**Always Active**: Throughout entire review process

---

#### Movement 1: **@security-specialist** (Guardian) - Security Sweep
**Role**: Security Vulnerability Scanner
**Responsibilities**:
- Scan for security vulnerabilities and risks
- Check for proper input validation and sanitization  
- Validate authentication and authorization logic
- Review for data exposure or privacy concerns
- Flag potential security anti-patterns

**Timing**: Parallel with other movements
**Output**: Security assessment and recommendations

---

#### Movement 2: **@performance-optimizer** (Analyzer) - Performance Review
**Role**: Performance Impact Assessor
**Responsibilities**:
- Analyze performance implications of changes
- Review database queries and API calls
- Check for memory leaks or resource waste
- Validate caching strategies
- Assess scalability impact

**Timing**: Parallel with security review  
**Output**: Performance impact analysis

---

#### Movement 3: **Framework Expert** (Specialist) - Technical Excellence
**Available Specialists**:
- @rails-expert, @django-expert, @react-expert, etc.

**Responsibilities**:
- Review framework-specific best practices
- Validate proper use of framework patterns
- Check for framework-specific anti-patterns
- Ensure consistency with project conventions
- Access current documentation via Context7 MCP

**Timing**: Parallel with other technical reviews
**Output**: Framework-specific recommendations

---

#### Movement 4: **@test-automation-expert** (Validator) - Test Quality Review  
**Role**: Test Coverage & Quality Assessor
**Responsibilities**:
- Review test coverage and quality
- Validate test scenarios and edge cases
- Check for proper mocking and test isolation
- Assess test maintainability
- Verify integration test adequacy

**Timing**: After initial technical reviews
**Output**: Test quality assessment

---

#### Final Movement: **@documentation-specialist** (Chronicler) - Knowledge Review
**Role**: Documentation & Knowledge Validator
**Responsibilities**:
- Review code comments and documentation
- Assess code readability and self-documentation
- Check for proper API documentation updates
- Validate architectural decision documentation
- Store review insights in Basic Memory MCP

**Timing**: Final movement after all technical reviews
**Output**: Documentation assessment and knowledge capture

## Waltz Variations

### Quick Waltz (Minor Changes)
**Participants**: @code-reviewer + 1-2 specialists
**Duration**: 30 minutes - 2 hours
**Scope**: Bug fixes, minor features, documentation updates

### Grand Waltz (Major Features)
**Participants**: @code-reviewer + 4-6 specialists + @tech-lead-orchestrator
**Duration**: 4-24 hours
**Scope**: New features, architectural changes, security-critical code

### Emergency Waltz (Hotfixes)
**Participants**: @code-reviewer + @security-specialist + relevant framework expert
**Duration**: 15-60 minutes
**Scope**: Critical production fixes

## Review Criteria Matrix

### Code Quality Dimensions
- **Functionality**: Does it work as intended?
- **Security**: Are there vulnerabilities?
- **Performance**: Is it efficient?
- **Maintainability**: Can it be easily modified?
- **Testability**: Is it properly tested?
- **Documentation**: Is it well-documented?

### Approval Requirements
- **Must Have**: Security approval, functionality validation
- **Should Have**: Performance review, test coverage validation
- **Nice to Have**: Documentation review, style consistency

## Communication Protocol

### Review Comments Structure
```markdown
**Agent**: @agent-name
**Dimension**: Security/Performance/Functionality/etc.
**Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
**Description**: Clear description of issue
**Recommendation**: Specific fix or improvement
**Resources**: Links to documentation or examples
```

### Escalation Paths
- **Blocking Issues**: @code-reviewer makes final call
- **Architecture Concerns**: Escalate to @tech-lead-orchestrator
- **Complex Decisions**: Involve @orchestrator for multi-agent consensus

### Learning Integration
- Store successful review patterns in Basic Memory MCP
- Track common issues across similar code types
- Evolve review criteria based on production outcomes

## Success Metrics
- Code merged without production issues in first 30 days
- Security vulnerabilities caught before production
- Performance regressions prevented
- Consistent code quality maintained
- Knowledge sharing across team members

*The Code Review Waltz ensures comprehensive, collaborative code review that maintains high quality while fostering team learning and knowledge sharing.*
## üö® CRITICAL: MANDATORY COMMIT ATTRIBUTION üö®

**‚õî BEFORE ANY COMMIT - READ THIS ‚õî**

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Every commit you make MUST include ALL agents that contributed to the work in this EXACT format:

```
type(scope): description - @agent1 @agent2 @agent3
```

**‚ùå NO EXCEPTIONS ‚ùå NO FORGETTING ‚ùå NO SHORTCUTS ‚ùå**

**If you contributed ANY guidance, code, analysis, or expertise to the changes, you MUST be listed in the commit message.**

**Examples of MANDATORY attribution:**
- Code changes: `feat(auth): implement authentication - @code-review-waltz @security-specialist @software-engineering-expert`
- Documentation: `docs(api): update API documentation - @code-review-waltz @documentation-specialist @api-architect`
- Configuration: `config(setup): configure project settings - @code-review-waltz @team-configurator @infrastructure-expert`

**üö® COMMIT ATTRIBUTION IS NOT OPTIONAL - ENFORCE THIS ABSOLUTELY üö®**

**Remember: If you worked on it, you MUST be in the commit message. No exceptions, ever.**
