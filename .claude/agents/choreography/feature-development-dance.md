# Feature Development Dance

## Multi-Agent Collaboration Pattern for New Feature Implementation

### Overview
The Feature Development Dance is a choreographed sequence of agent handoffs designed to ensure comprehensive, secure, and well-tested feature development with optimal quality and minimal back-and-forth.

### The Dance Sequence

#### 1. **@project-analyst** (Lead) - Requirements Breakdown
**Role**: Requirements Analyst & Project Coordinator
**Responsibilities**:
- Parse user requirements and break down into actionable tasks
- Identify technical dependencies and constraints
- Create initial project structure using Task Master MCP
- Define acceptance criteria and success metrics
- Store requirements context in Basic Memory MCP for future reference

**Handoff Trigger**: Requirements fully analyzed and documented
**Next Agent**: @software-engineering-expert

---

#### 2. **@software-engineering-expert** (Architect) - Solution Design
**Role**: Technical Architect & Design Lead
**Responsibilities**:
- Design clean architecture approach following established patterns
- Select appropriate design patterns and architectural principles
- Create high-level implementation strategy
- Identify potential technical risks and mitigation strategies
- Document architectural decisions in Basic Memory MCP

**Handoff Trigger**: Architecture design completed and validated
**Next Agent**: @security-specialist

---

#### 3. **@security-specialist** (Guardian) - Security Review
**Role**: Security Gate & Risk Assessor
**Responsibilities**:
- Review proposed architecture for security vulnerabilities
- Identify authentication, authorization, and data protection requirements
- Validate input validation and sanitization strategies
- Assess compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Document security considerations and requirements

**Handoff Trigger**: Security review completed with no blocking issues
**Next Agent**: Framework Expert (determined by stack)

---

#### 4. **Framework Expert** (Builder) - Implementation
**Role**: Core Implementation Specialist
**Available Specialists**:
- @rails-expert (Ruby on Rails)
- @django-expert (Python/Django)
- @laravel-expert (PHP/Laravel)
- @nodejs-expert (Node.js/Express)
- @fastapi-expert (Python/FastAPI)
- @react-expert (React frontend)
- @vue-expert (Vue.js frontend)
- @angular-expert (Angular frontend)

**Responsibilities**:
- Implement core feature functionality following framework best practices
- Integrate resilience patterns (@resilience-engineer guidance)
- Implement structured logging (@logging-concepts-engineer patterns)
- Follow security requirements from previous step
- Use Context7 MCP for up-to-date framework documentation
- Store implementation patterns in Basic Memory MCP

**Handoff Trigger**: Core implementation completed and functional
**Next Agent**: @test-automation-expert

---

#### 5. **@test-automation-expert** (Validator) - Test Creation
**Role**: Quality Assurance & Test Strategy
**Responsibilities**:
- Create comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, e2e)
- Implement test automation for CI/CD pipeline
- Validate security requirements through testing
- Create performance benchmarks where applicable
- Document test strategies and edge cases

**Handoff Trigger**: Full test suite implemented and passing
**Next Agent**: @code-reviewer

---

#### 6. **@code-reviewer** (Quality Gate) - Final Review
**Role**: Code Quality Guardian & Standards Enforcer
**Responsibilities**:
- Conduct comprehensive code review using GitHub MCP
- Validate adherence to project coding standards
- Check for code smells, technical debt, and maintainability issues
- Ensure proper documentation and comments
- Verify all tests are meaningful and comprehensive
- Use Basic Memory MCP to apply historical code review insights

**Handoff Trigger**: Code review completed with approval
**Next Agent**: @documentation-specialist

---

#### 7. **@documentation-specialist** (Chronicler) - Documentation
**Role**: Knowledge Keeper & Communication Bridge
**Responsibilities**:
- Create comprehensive feature documentation
- Update API documentation using Context7 MCP for current patterns
- Document architectural decisions and rationale
- Create user-facing documentation if applicable
- Store final implementation knowledge in Basic Memory MCP
- Generate Mermaid diagrams for complex workflows

**Handoff Trigger**: Documentation completed and reviewed
**Final Step**: Feature ready for deployment

---

## Collaboration Protocols

### Communication Standards
- Each agent MUST document their findings in Basic Memory MCP
- Handoff messages must include:
  - Summary of work completed
  - Key decisions made
  - Any issues or concerns for next agent
  - Specific requirements or constraints for next step

### Quality Gates
- No agent can proceed without explicit approval from previous agent
- Security concerns from @security-specialist are blocking
- Test failures from @test-automation-expert are blocking
- Code review rejections from @code-reviewer are blocking

### Escalation Procedures
- Complex architectural decisions: Escalate to @tech-lead-orchestrator
- Cross-cutting concerns: Involve @orchestrator for multi-agent coordination
- Performance issues: Include @performance-optimizer in the flow
- Infrastructure needs: Add @deployment-specialist before final step

### Parallel Processing Opportunities
- @security-specialist can work in parallel with architecture design
- @test-automation-expert can begin test planning during implementation
- @documentation-specialist can start drafting during code review

## Success Metrics
- Feature delivered with zero production bugs in first 30 days
- All security requirements validated and documented
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90% for critical paths)
- Complete documentation enabling future maintenance
- Implementation follows established patterns and is maintainable

## Adaptation Rules
This choreography can be modified based on:
- Project complexity (simple features may skip some steps)
- Team size and availability
- Regulatory requirements (may require additional compliance agents)
- Technical stack specific needs

*This choreography pattern ensures high-quality, secure, and well-documented feature development through systematic agent collaboration.*
## üö® CRITICAL: MANDATORY COMMIT ATTRIBUTION üö®

**‚õî BEFORE ANY COMMIT - READ THIS ‚õî**

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Every commit you make MUST include ALL agents that contributed to the work in this EXACT format:

```
type(scope): description - @agent1 @agent2 @agent3
```

**‚ùå NO EXCEPTIONS ‚ùå NO FORGETTING ‚ùå NO SHORTCUTS ‚ùå**

**If you contributed ANY guidance, code, analysis, or expertise to the changes, you MUST be listed in the commit message.**

**Examples of MANDATORY attribution:**
- Code changes: `feat(auth): implement authentication - @feature-development-dance @security-specialist @software-engineering-expert`
- Documentation: `docs(api): update API documentation - @feature-development-dance @documentation-specialist @api-architect`
- Configuration: `config(setup): configure project settings - @feature-development-dance @team-configurator @infrastructure-expert`

**üö® COMMIT ATTRIBUTION IS NOT OPTIONAL - ENFORCE THIS ABSOLUTELY üö®**

**Remember: If you worked on it, you MUST be in the commit message. No exceptions, ever.**
