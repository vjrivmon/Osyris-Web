# Bug Hunting Tango

## Multi-Agent Collaboration Pattern for Bug Investigation & Resolution

### Overview
The Bug Hunting Tango is a systematic approach to identifying, analyzing, and resolving bugs through coordinated agent expertise, ensuring thorough investigation and prevention of similar issues.

### The Tango Sequence

#### 1. **@error-detective** (Investigator) - Bug Analysis
**Role**: Primary Investigator & Evidence Gatherer
**Responsibilities**:
- Analyze error logs and stack traces
- Reproduce the bug consistently
- Identify error patterns and frequency
- Gather evidence from monitoring systems
- Store investigation findings in Basic Memory MCP

**Handoff Conditions**: Bug reproduced and evidence collected
**Next Agent**: @code-archaeologist

---

#### 2. **@code-archaeologist** (Explorer) - Codebase Investigation
**Role**: Code Detective & Context Builder
**Responsibilities**:
- Trace bug through codebase to identify root cause
- Analyze recent changes that might have introduced the issue
- Review related code sections for similar patterns
- Identify technical debt contributing to the problem
- Map dependencies and affected components

**Handoff Conditions**: Root cause identified and documented
**Next Agent**: Framework Expert

---

#### 3. **Framework Expert** (Fixer) - Solution Implementation
**Available Specialists**:
- @rails-expert, @django-expert, @laravel-expert, @nodejs-expert, etc.

**Responsibilities**:
- Implement targeted fix following framework best practices
- Ensure fix doesn't introduce new issues
- Add logging and monitoring for future detection
- Follow security guidelines if security-related
- Test fix in isolation

**Handoff Conditions**: Fix implemented and locally tested
**Next Agent**: @test-automation-expert

---

#### 4. **@test-automation-expert** (Validator) - Regression Prevention
**Role**: Quality Guardian & Future Protection
**Responsibilities**:
- Create specific test cases for the resolved bug
- Run comprehensive regression test suite
- Add monitoring/alerting for early detection
- Validate fix doesn't break existing functionality
- Document test scenarios for similar issues

**Handoff Conditions**: All tests passing, regression protection in place
**Next Agent**: @performance-optimizer (if performance-related) OR @code-reviewer

---

#### 5. **@code-reviewer** (Approver) - Final Validation
**Role**: Quality Gate & Knowledge Validator
**Responsibilities**:
- Review fix for code quality and maintainability
- Ensure proper error handling and logging
- Validate fix addresses root cause, not just symptoms
- Check for potential side effects
- Approve deployment readiness

**Handoff Conditions**: Fix approved and ready for deployment
**Final Step**: Bug resolved and protected against recurrence

## Specialized Tango Variations

### Performance Bug Tango
**Additional Participants**: @performance-optimizer, @database-admin
- Performance analysis and optimization
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategy implementation

### Security Bug Tango  
**Additional Participants**: @security-specialist, @security-auditor
- Security impact assessment
- Vulnerability remediation
- Security testing validation

### Infrastructure Bug Tango
**Additional Participants**: @devops-troubleshooter, @incident-responder
- System-level debugging
- Infrastructure fix implementation
- Monitoring and alerting setup

## Communication Protocols

### Evidence Chain
- Each agent MUST document findings in Basic Memory MCP
- Preserve debugging context for future similar issues
- Link related issues and patterns

### Urgency Levels
- **P0 (Critical)**: All agents work in parallel, @incident-responder leads
- **P1 (High)**: Standard tango sequence with expedited handoffs
- **P2 (Medium)**: Normal tango with optional parallel work
- **P3 (Low)**: Can be interrupted for higher priority work

### Learning Integration
- Store resolution patterns in Basic Memory MCP
- Update choreography based on lessons learned
- Share insights across similar framework experts

## üö® CRITICAL: MANDATORY COMMIT ATTRIBUTION üö®

**‚õî BEFORE ANY COMMIT - READ THIS ‚õî**

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Every commit you make MUST include ALL agents that contributed to the work in this EXACT format:

```
type(scope): description - @agent1 @agent2 @agent3
```

**‚ùå NO EXCEPTIONS ‚ùå NO FORGETTING ‚ùå NO SHORTCUTS ‚ùå**

**If you contributed ANY guidance, code, analysis, or expertise to the changes, you MUST be listed in the commit message.**

**Examples of MANDATORY attribution:**
- Code changes: `feat(auth): implement authentication - @bug-hunting-tango @security-specialist @software-engineering-expert`
- Documentation: `docs(api): update API documentation - @bug-hunting-tango @documentation-specialist @api-architect`
- Configuration: `config(setup): configure project settings - @bug-hunting-tango @team-configurator @infrastructure-expert`

**üö® COMMIT ATTRIBUTION IS NOT OPTIONAL - ENFORCE THIS ABSOLUTELY üö®**

**Remember: If you worked on it, you MUST be in the commit message. No exceptions, ever.**
