### 6. üìÅ Dual Upload Management
Unified upload controller with environment detection:

#### Unified Controller (`upload.controller.js`)
- Automatic environment detection
- Seamless switching between local and Supabase
- Fallback implementations

## üöÄ How to Use the System

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository>
cd Osyris-Web

# Run setup script
./scripts/setup-dev.sh

# Start development
./scripts/dev-start.sh
```

### Environment Switching

#### Switch to Local Development
```bash
# Using Claude command
/local-dev

# Or manually
node .claude/hooks/hook-manager.js --switch development
```

#### Deploy to Production
```bash
# Using Claude command
/supabase-deploy

# Or manually
node .claude/hooks/hook-manager.js --switch production
```

### Database Migration

#### Generate Migration
```bash
node .claude/migrations/generate-migration.js
```

#### Apply Migration
```bash
/migrate-schema --to-version 1.2.0
```

### Data Synchronization

#### Sync Production to Local
```bash
/sync-data --direction production-to-local
```

#### Sync Local to Production
```bash
/sync-data --direction local-to-production
```

## üìã Environment Detection

The system automatically detects the environment based on:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - `NODE_ENV` (development/production)
   - `DATABASE_TYPE` (sqlite/supabase)

2. **Configuration Files**
   - `db.config.js` - Database configuration
   - `supabase.config.js` - Supabase settings

3. **Automatic Switching**
   - Controllers detect environment
   - Appropriate implementations loaded
   - Seamless operation switching

## üîí Security Features

### Credential Management
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Never hardcode credentials
- Automatic credential validation
- Secure storage in production

### Data Protection
- Automatic data anonymization for development
- Row Level Security in Supabase
- Encrypted file transfers
- Audit logging for all operations

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions
- API key validation
- Session management
- Activity monitoring

## üìà Performance Optimizations

### Database
- Connection pooling
- Query optimization
- Index management
- Batch operations

### File Storage
- CDN integration
- Image optimization
- Lazy loading
- Compression

### Deployment
- Zero-downtime migrations
- Blue-green deployments
- Progressive rollouts
- Health monitoring

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Pre-Deployment Tests
```bash
node .claude/hooks/scripts/validate-production-readiness.js
```

### Migration Testing
```bash
node .claude/migrations/generate-migration.js --dry-run
```

### Health Checks
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

## üìä Monitoring & Logging

### Log Locations
- `.claude/logs/` - Hook execution logs
- `api-osyris/logs/` - Backend logs
- `logs/` - General system logs

### Metrics
- Deployment duration
- Migration success rate
- Upload performance
- Error frequency

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Port Already in Use
```bash
./scripts/kill-services.sh
```

#### Database Connection Failed
```bash
# Recreate SQLite database
rm api-osyris/database/osyris.db
npm run dev:backend
```

#### Migration Failed
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
/migrate-schema --rollback
```

#### Upload Issues
```bash
# Check storage configuration
curl http://localhost:5000/api/uploads/config
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. Always work in local development first
2. Test thoroughly before migration
3. Use dry-run options for validation
4. Create backups before major changes

### Deployment Process
1. Validate production readiness
2. Create database backup
3. Run migrations with validation
4. Monitor deployment health
5. Be ready to rollback if needed

### Data Management
1. Anonymize production data for development
2. Use batch operations for large datasets
3. Validate data integrity after sync
4. Monitor storage usage
